# Permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN for this workflow.
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token
#
# NOTE: Because we run with minimal permissions, we use "@vX" (instead of "@hash") for non-GitHub steps below.
#   Usually you would use "@hash" as a security measure to pin a specific version. However, since we run with
#   minimal permissions here, malicious code can't do much harm (most likely). For more details, see:
