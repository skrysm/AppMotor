#
# GitHub Actions workflow: Builds and tests the code in this repository.
#
# For more details on workflows, see README.md.
#
# NOTES:
#
# * We don't use CodeQL because it takes, at the time of writing, 3 minutes to run which is
#   3x the time of the "build-and-test" job. Since we already have the Microsoft Code Analysis
#   enabled, I don't expect CodeQL to offer much advantages (especially compared to the time it
#   takes to execute).

# When to run this workflow
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on
#
# TIP: Don't use "schedule" triggers as this will cause the workflow to be disabled after 60 days of inactivity
#   (and afterward the workflow must be manually reenabled).
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push to the main branch.
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  # Trigger the workflow for any pull requests.

  # Allow manual run of this workflow (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow)

# Permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN for this workflow.

# See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token
#
# NOTE: Because we run with minimal permissions, we use "@vX" (instead of "@hash") for non-GitHub steps below.
#   Usually you would use "@hash" as a security measure to pin a specific version. However, since we run with
#   minimal permissions here, malicious code can't do much harm (most likely). For more details, see:
