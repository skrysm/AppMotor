This becomes a problem at the \"boundaries\" - i.e. the various ways of how the secrets would enter or leave the process.","All of .NET's I/O classes (e.g. File, Stream, HttpClient) use various methods of buffering or even string building when used. All of these may leak (parts of) the secrets they read or write - especially if there is an exception (since none of the implementations clears their buffers when exceptions occur).","For most of these problems, we found ways to reduce the chance of leaking. But all of these ways relied on knowing exactly how the various methods are implemented.
